ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Natalia Rovere. 
I'am an UX UI Designer, Architect and Artist. 


ABOUT ME:

I consider myself a highly creative, dedicated and committed individual and I'm always seeking opportunities to learn and grow.

I enjoy the challenge of designing with a focus on simplifying or solving problems for a client or user. This motivation to seek improvement and optimization is something I have applied both in my career as an Architect and as a UX/UI Designer.

I am passionate about connecting with others and empathizing with their thoughts and feelings. This passion has led me to volunteer for over seven years with an NGO called MÃ³dulo Sanitario, which builds bathrooms and teaches hygiene habits to families in sanitary emergency.

Through this experience, along with my work opportunities, I have been able to develop leadership and teamwork skills.
